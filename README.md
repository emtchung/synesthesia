# synesthesia
A drawing machine in Processing that illustrates synesthesia with audio. 

In Processing, I worked on coding the program to take in audio input, either from a mic or uploaded song or both, to create shapes in which its size will be based on the volume level. This process involved getting audio data from the sounds we would be using, i.e. the mic and songs, and analyzing the amplitude of the songs to decide at what level would be considered, loud, average, and soft sounds.

Users are given a choice of 12 Royalty-Free songs to choose from without knowing what those songs are, and afterwards, they can change the color and shape representing the song as the song plays.

Additionaly, users can mute/unmute their mic and do the same with choosing the shapes and colors to represent the mic. Users have the choice to have their mic object representations follow the mouse cursor or to be random. If the user’s mic input gets too loud, all song objects will turn into a random color for a few seconds.
​
When the user is finished creating their piece, they can take a screenshot or clear the screen to reset. The users can continue to play another song or play the same song to continue adding pieces to their work. Overall, the end product will show an abstract art piece of synesthesia through audio. 

In order to test it out, please download all files in one folder.
